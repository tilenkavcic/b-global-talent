# Grid supply and demand forecasting

Electricity grid demand and supply prediction for Arteche

This repository showcases the model implementation for the B global talent hackathon and bootcamp. 
The code is not meant to be extensible, is not documented and most likely has some flaws.

Focused on the Spainsh grid, implemented models are:
- monthly aggregated grid demand prediction 
- daily aggregated grid supply forecasts based on weather forecasts:
  - wind supply prediction
  - solar supply prediction
